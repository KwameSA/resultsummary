## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Variables
*

### What I learned


```html
<button class="continue">
  Continue
 </button>
```
```css
background: linear-gradient(to bottom, var(--clr-Violet-blue), var(--clr-Persian-blue));
.score-number p {
  border-radius: 50%;
  aspect-ratio: 1/1;
  display: flex;
  height: 10rem;
  width: 10rem;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development
I still want to improve on my understanding on the use of flexbox
I want to futher learn how to use CSS Variables to make workflow easier.
The use of variables to make workflow smooth and easy has further motivated me to go in harder as I am learning JavaScript
I want to understand how to better use media queries


### Useful resources

Irvine Mesa and Kevin Powell helped me increase workflow and reduce redundancy
